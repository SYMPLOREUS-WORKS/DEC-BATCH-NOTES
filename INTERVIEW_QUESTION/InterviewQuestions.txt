===============================================================
operators and control statements
1.What is the difference between while loop and do-while loop?
2.Explain the scenerios where we can use the while loop?
3.Explain the behaviour of + operator?
4.What is the difference between pre-increment and post-increment operator?
5.What is the difference between & operator and && operator?

13.How is the switch statement different from a series of if-else statements? Which one is more efficient?
14.Can a switch statement use String as a parameter? How does it work internally?
it uses hashcode and equals method for comparision
15.Can a switch statement use float as a parameter? Justify
16. What is the difference between break and continue? Provide an example
17.Can a for loop have multiple initialization and increment expressions? Provide an example.
18.What is the purpose of a default label in a switch statement? Is it mandatory to include it?
19.Explain the concept of "fall-through" in a switch statement. How can it be prevented?
20.Can break and continue be used inside a try-catch-finally block? If yes, how do they behave?
21.Can control statements like break or return be used inside a lambda expression? Why or why not?
Need to know about the stream api as well
22.What are all the datatypes applicable for the switch parameter?
23.Why float,double and long are not allowed as the switch parameter?If we have a scenario with float or double parameter how to use it 
24.How switch-case works wrt to primitives and Wrapper classes?
for primitives direct value comparision will happen
for wrappers it convert to primitive using auto unboxing 
25.Explain the comparision mechanism of switch-case w.r.t enum data type
It uses ordinal value for the comparision
26.Explain enhanced switch and yield keyword?
